Experminted with moving CSS to SASS. Some of the SASS is just plain CSS.

TODO: 
+ Take advantage of SASS fully
+ Cleanup SASS. It can be simplified a lot. Because we were not provided
mockups at all, or for some pages very late, didn't understand requirements
and kept guessing. Now that the style is finalized needs a complete rewrite/cleanup.
